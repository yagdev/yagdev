Hey, I'm YAG-dev. You might know me from my main project, Treble Toolkit. If you don't, it's okay, here's a quick introduction:
I started coding in early 2020 using batch files in Windows and later kind of learned how to code for the Linux terminal too. However I got much more ambicious and started coding with a fully fledged GUI. I called that project Treble Toolkit. It came out in June 2020 and I'm still actively working on it. I also have other pasttime hobbies such as gaming. I have also made my contributions on that field too, mainly with a Minecraft mod called "Game Consoles Mod" that adds game consoles to the game with self-made 3D models and a GTA mod called "Beta Radio Stations Mod" that I sometimes work on that aims to replicate the beta radio stations on that game.
