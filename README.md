Hey, I'm YAG-dev. You might know me from my most popular project, Treble Toolkit. If you don't, that's okay, here's a quick introduction:
I started coding in early 2020 using batch files in Windows and later kind of learned how to code for the Linux terminal too. However I got much more ambicious and started coding with a fully fledged GUI using Xaml and C#. I called that project Treble Toolkit. Treble Toolkit was worked on until August 2022. After came a smaller project for Minecraft mod distribution in early 2022, however that was mostly a smaller project. In September 2023, Lyrics for Discord Rich Presence was released for showing synced lyrics in Discord. This project was later ported into a function of my newest project, Companion Display, which is an app that aims to give life to a secondary display and fully supports touch input, which allows for some interesting use cases. I also have other pasttime hobbies such as gaming. I have also made my contributions on that field too, mainly with a Minecraft mod called "Game Consoles Mod" that adds game consoles to the game with self-made 3D models and a GTA mod called "Beta Radio Stations Mod" that I sometimes work on that aims to replicate the beta radio stations on that game.
